## Hypothesis:

By analyzing a collected dataset, we will investigate whether achieving objectives in League of Legends is related to a higher probability of victory. We will examine metrics such as taking towers, controlling dragons, and securing Baron Nashor to understand their impact on the final results. Our hypothesis suggests that goal attainment is positively linked to the probability of winning. These findings could be useful for improving the performance and strategy of non-professional level players in League of Legends.
